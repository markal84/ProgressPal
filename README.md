## Key Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** ProgressPal provides a secure user registration and authentication system. Users can create accounts and log in to access their personalized workout tracking features. The backend handles user authentication and data storage, which is deployed on Render.com.

- **Exercise Tracking:** With ProgressPal, users can easily track their exercises. They can add exercises to their workouts and specify details such as the exercise name, sets, reps, and weights. This feature allows users to keep a record of their progress and monitor their performance over time.

- **Data Persistence:** All workout and exercise data entered by users is securely stored in a MongoDB Atlas cloud database. This ensures data integrity and availability, allowing users to access their data from anywhere with an internet connection.
